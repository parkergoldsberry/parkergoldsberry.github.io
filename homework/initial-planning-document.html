    <h2>Site Purpose Statement</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this weather site is to display the weather for various locations. The users will be widely varied, as most people like to see what the weather will do at least once in a while. The site will show the weather forcast with the details of the city, state, high temperature, low temperature, precipitation, wind direction, wind speed, and summary. The goal of this website is to have information well laid out to make it easy to find at all times of the day, and to have people always coming back to our website because it loads quick, is accurate, and gives them what they are looking for. </p>

    <h2>Audience Description</h2>
    <p>Specifically, the site will be used by people who need to do something outside (like drive, walk, or play), and people with responsibilities who need to make decisions based on the weather. These responsabilities could be anything from a school district superintendent needing to decide if school should be held, to a farmer needing to know if they should go ahead and plant or fertilize, a parent needing to know how to dress up their kids for the day, or a business owner trying to decide how much of something they are likely to sell based on the weather. It is likely that the site will be accessed by people of all income levels and occupation types, all levels of education, young and old, living around the areas for which the weather data will be reported.</p>

She will visit the site every day, or even multiple times a day, to check the forecast and use it to determine how much of their famous hot chocolate to brew.
