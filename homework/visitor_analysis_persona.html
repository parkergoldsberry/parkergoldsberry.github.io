            <h2>Good site: indeed.com</h2>

                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
                <p><em>Target Audience:</em> Any people that are working age (16+), but seems to have more emphasis on adult type jobs (18+). Serves many types of jobs to people with all incomes. This site serves jobs that are not very entry-level, almost all require people with at least a high school diploma but often some other college, experience, or training is required. The site serves jobs wherever you search in the country, when I use it it targets people in the Fort Collins, Colorado area.</p>
                <p>The visitors that visit this site are looking for jobs in a specific location, they need to be able to see jobs that are close to them, a person in who lives in Idaho is probably not looking for a job in Maine or some other random place. The site gives the results from the job search in a nice list and lets you quickly view the different jobs people are looking to fill. On most of the jobs, it has the information of what type of person they are looking for, what education they need, the job location, what they are thinking of paying them, and other details. It gives them what they need without a lot of animation or distrations. When you enter the site, there are only two boxes, one for a search term and one for location. Then it takes you right to the results that can be viewed one by one, one after the other. It has good simple functionality.  </p>
                <p>The content was organized in a list for the job search results, and after clicking on a job it shows the details of that job. From there it is easy to go back to the search results.</p>
                <p>The mobile experience was made enjoyable because of its quickness and how it displayed the text in one column viewable in one screen. The site wasn't trying to load a ton of stuff that would have slowed it down and kept the person from getting what they are looking for.</p>
                <p>This site facilitated people in a mobile environment by keeping the page quick to load, without any unneccesary images, and ny making the text viewable in one screen without having to move around to read it all.It also had a good, quick navigation to get back to the search results.</p>

                <h2>Persona</h2>
                <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the persona reading to build a persona for this site-->
                <p>Persona: Someone recently laid off</p>
                <p>Fictional Name: George Madsen</p>
                <p>Job Experience: Has worked for 10 years in the city government as an office worker.</p>
                <p>Demographics: <li>30 years old</li>

                </p>

            <section id="Site Contrast">
                <h2>Site Contrast</h2>
                <p>Worst Site: Craigslist (fortcollins.craigslist.org)
                </p>
                <p>2. The best site really knew who it wanted to attract, Craigslist also did but it was a lot less organized and it took longer to find exactly what you are looking for.</p>
                <p>3. The best site indeed.com better served the needs of people who are looking for jobs. It's information was well organized. The job listings on indeed had many details about the jobs, craigslist's listings are not always organized or complete with information.</p>
                <p>4. In terms of how well the content was organized, indeed was better because the results it displayed were more what people are looking for. Craigslist's search results are not always as spot on and related to what you are looking for.</p>
                <p>5. Indeed's mobile site was well made, quick, and without a bunch of distractions. Craigslist's pages didn't really conform to a mobile screen. It's pages were hard to read and required moving the screen little by little back and forth to see the whole thing. </p>
